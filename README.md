## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I strengthened my understanding about the ::before and ::after pseudo-element. I also learned properties that i didn't know before, such as background-size and background-position.

some meaningful code snippets:

```css
.storage-left::after {
  content: '';
  transform: rotate(180deg);
  ...
}
background-position: bottom;
background-size: 100% 50%;
```


### Continued development

I want to continue mastering my css skills. I want to keep improving my grid and flexbox skills. I also want to focus on pseudo-elements.


### Useful resources

- [W3 School](https://my-learning.w3schools.com/courses/?tut=css) - This helped me understand pseudo-elements like ::after and ::before
